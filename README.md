# To-Do React Application
#### By: Daniel Snell

## Overview
This application is a functional task management app that allows a user to create, view, and check off to-do items on a list. A map is used to display the tasks in the list. A form above that can be used to add tasks to the list. There is a filter on the bottom that can toggle between all tasks, checked off tasks, and unchecked tasks. There is also a contact form.

## Technologies Used
I used html, css, js, and react for this project

## Future Improvements
1. The checkmark boxes are a little janky. One click changes the class of the tr to unchecked or checked (depending as needed) and then a second click is needed to visually change it. If I did this project again, I'd make it all happen in one click.
2. I never actually made any new components for this project. There are places where I could have, but I didn't want to make this more confusing for myself, so I just never did, besides making the mock-data.json
3. Maybe make the website more colorful? I ended up only using gold, purple, and white because I like the colorscheme, but perhaps it's a bit too basic.
